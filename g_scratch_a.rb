 File.open("out.txt", 'OPTION') {|f| f.write("write your stuff here") }

where your options are:

r - Read only. The file must exist.
w - Create an empty file for writing.
a - Append to a file.The file is created if it does not exist.
r+ - Open a file for update both reading and writing. The file must exist.
w+ - Create an empty file for both reading and writing.
a+ - Open a file for reading and appending. The file is created if it does not exist.

In your case, w is preferable.

OR you could have:

    outFile = File.new("out.txt", "w")
    ...
    outFile.puts("write your stuff here")
    ...
    outFile.close
